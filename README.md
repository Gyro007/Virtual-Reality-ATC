## Description
This is an engineering project under Harvard Extension School for the course DGMD S-14 Wearable Devices and Computer Vision. In this project, we have created a virtual reality experience using Unity. It simulates the interior of an air traffic control tower. Users can roam freely within the control tower and view the artificial airfield made using a skybox. In the market currently, most ATC simulators require a physical location and is primarily focused on letting ATC trainees rehearse their radio telephony through the simulated tower frequencies. In the wearable space, V-Air Traffic Control game allows players to interact with 3 speaking units and put items into the drawer below their ATC console which is slightly different from our project. The purpose of this project is to allow air traffic control trainees to become familiar with the control tower environment without being physically present at an ATC simulator and allow them to be familiar with the objects within the tower.

## Unity:
This project is created for the following Unity version: 2021.2.8f1
You will need an IDE such as Visual Studio Community and other usual Unity dependencies: https://unity.com/download

### Key Information
- The C# scripts can be found in: "/Assets/MyScripts/"
- The tower scene can be found in: "/Assets/Scenes/"
- After downloading unity just put all the files in this repository into your project folder and you should be able to run it
